# Description 
Data structures and algorithms form the fundamental building blocks of computer science and are essential for efficient problem-solving. 
They provide a systematic way to organize and manipulate data. Array, LinkedList, Stack, Tree, Graph, Hashtable, and Sliding Window are some of the key data structures and
algorithms. Arrays offer fast random access and contiguous memory storage, while LinkedLists provide dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion operations. 
Stacks follow the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle and are useful for tasks like expression evaluation and backtracking. 
Trees are hierarchical structures with nodes and edges, enabling efficient searching, insertion, and deletion operations. 
Graphs represent connections between entities and are used for modeling complex relationships. Hashtables offer constant-time lookup using key-value pairs. 
liding Window is an algorithmic technique that efficiently processes a fixed-size subarray of elements. 
Understanding these data structures and algorithms is crucial for designing efficient algorithms, 
optimizing code performance, and solving complex computational problems.
